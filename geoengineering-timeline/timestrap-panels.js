            details: "Vincent Schaefer (1906–1993) discovered the principle of cloud seeding in July 1946 through a series of serendipitous events. Following ideas generated between himself and Nobel laureate Irving Langmuir while climbing Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, Schaefer, Langmuir's research associate, created a way of experimenting with supercooled clouds using a deep freeze unit of potential agents to stimulate ice crystal growth, i.e., table salt, talcum powder, soils, dust and various chemical agents with minor effect. Then one hot and humid July 14, 1946, he wanted to try a few experiments at General Electric's Schenectady Research Lab.<br><br>He was dismayed to find that the deep freezer was not cold enough to produce a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; using breath air. He decided to move the process along by adding a chunk of dry ice just to lower the temperature of his experimental chamber. To his astonishment, as soon as he breathed into the deep freezer, a bluish haze was noted, followed by an eye-popping display of millions of microscopic ice crystals, reflecting the strong light rays from the lamp illuminating a cross-section of the chamber. He instantly realized that he had discovered a way to change supercooled water into ice crystals. The experiment was easily replicated and he explored the temperature gradient to establish the −40 °C limit for liquid water.<br><br>Within the month, Schaefer's colleague, the noted atmospheric scientist Dr. Bernard Vonnegut (brother of novelist Kurt Vonnegut) is credited with discovering another method for &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; supercooled cloud water. Vonnegut accomplished his discovery at the desk, looking up information in a basic chemistry text and then tinkering with silver and iodide chemicals to produce silver iodide. Together with Professor Henry Chessin, SUNY Albany, a crystallographer, he co-authored a publication in Science Magazine  and received a patent in 1975. Both methods were adopted for use in cloud seeding during 1946 while working for the General Electric Corporation in the state of New York.<br><br>Schaefer's altered a cloud's heat budget, Vonnegut's altered formative crystal structure – an ingenious property related to a good match in lattice constant between the two types of crystal. (The crystallography of ice later played a role in Kurt Vonnegut's novel Cat's Cradle.) <strong>The first attempt to modify natural clouds in the field through &ldquo;cloud seeding&rduo; began during a flight that began in upstate New York on 13 November 1946.</strong> Schaefer was able to cause snow to fall near Mount Greylock in western Massachusetts, after he dumped six pounds of dry ice into the target cloud from a plane after a 60-mile easterly chase from the Schenectady County Airport.",

Representatives of 31 major domestic airlines agreed to install &ldquo;burner cans&rdquo; to eliminate most of the smoke from their nearly 1,000 aircraft by 1972.</blockquote><blockquote>The government will tell the nation’s 43 commercial airlines Tuesday that they must end pollution of the skies with jet engine smoke by 1972 or face punitive legislation from Congress. Mainly at issue is the installation of a redesigned combuster – or burner can – on 3,000 existing commercial jet engines of one maker that reportedly account for 70 percent of all smoke pollution from airliners.</blockquote><blockquote>There will be a marked aesthetic improvement, since the so-called burner cans cut out something like 70 percent of the visible pollution and thus the familiar &ldquo;black belch&rdquo; will be seen no more.</blockquote><blockquote><p>A jet air plane in one landing and takeoff drenches the environment with as much soot as 2,500 automobiles produce in a entire day… soot, gases of carbon monoxide, aldehydes (irritants in smog), hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. 10,000 tons of particulate matter (three airports)</p></blockquote>",

They’re actually long, slender clouds. Other men are finding them especially fascinating because the theory is being developed that those long, white lines may be changing our weather for the better. Details from Roger O’Neil.</p><p>ROGER O’NEIL, reporting:</p><p>The exhaust from jet engines, usually seen as long, thin trails of white clouds behind high-flying jet airplanes, may be a big reason why there are 30 fewer days of sunshine a year in the Midwest now than there were in 1900. The daily range between high and low temperatures has also narrowed. Weather researchers, studying cloud cover in 10 Midwestern states, found a sharp increase in cloudiness with the increase in commercial jet travel, particularly in the main East-West jet corridor, there were even more clouds. A jet produces a contrail or cloud because its exhaust consists primarily of water vapor.</p><p>RICHARD SEMONIN (Illinois Institute of Natural Resources): In the absence of natural clouds, given the correct atmospheric condition, jet aircraft in high frequency can almost completely cover the atmosphere, visible atmosphere, with clouds.</p><p>O’NEIL: Semonin says, <strong>unlike most changes in the atmosphere caused by man, <span style='color: #ff0000;'>this one is beneficial</span>.</strong> Clouds help farmers in the Midwest by blocking the sun. Temperature extremes can damage plants and speed up the evaporation of soil moisture. In the Winter, city people benefit because clouds act as a blanket, preventing warm air from escaping into the atmosphere. No one is trying to make clouds now using jet engines, but this study suggests that jet travel is inadvertently making our days more cloudy and <strong>some day, weather researchers may be able to <span style='color: #ff0000;''>use jets on purpose to change our weather</span></strong>.</p></blockquote>",

Observations of the striated plasma screen, or &ldquo;picket fence,&rdquo; would provide information about some of the properties of the local ionospheric plasma as well as the ionization produced by the electron gun. It could also conceivably be used as a diffraction screen for HF/VHF radio transmissions</p><p>The picket fence produced in the ionosphere is a form of ionospheric modification, and our work on the topic led us to consider what further forms of ionospheric modification might be produced by energetic particle or photon beams. Support for a study of these concepts in ionospheric modification was provided early in 1986 by AFGL and the research portion of the study concluded at the end of September 1986. We should point out that the study was one of new concepts in ionospheric modification, based on our electron beam work, and thus no effort was directed toward work on ionospheric modification by means of <strong>high-powered ground-based incoherent scatter radars</strong>, or by other well-established methods such as <strong>barium or other similar chemical releases in the ionosphere.</strong>",

            details: "Satellite explorations of the near earth environment have vastly increased our understanding of space plasmas and their interactions with systems. A logical next step involves active experiments in which small quantities of matter and energy are injected into space environments. These experiments seek to verify tentative, scientific understanding and to identify ways to control environmental effects on systems. Serious questions may be raised regarding the legitimacy of conducting active experiments in space under United States military auspices. Here we review the treaty obligations regarding space environment modification to which the United States government has committed itself. Experiments involving the detonation of nuclear devices or interference with foreign space assets, especially national technical means to verification, are explicitly forbidden. In planned these experiments great care must be exerted so that they produce no widespread, long-lasting or severe effects on the environment. We also review active experiments programs conducted by U.S. civilian and foreign space agencies. Finally, the treaty restrictions are applied to the case of a hypothetical experiment to establish the feasibility of controlling the flux of energetic particles trapped in the earth's radiation belts. <strong>An ability to reduce trapped radiation would increase orbit selection options for future space-based surveillance systems.</strong> Keywords: Radiation belts; Wave-particle interactions; Environment modification.",

Such a capability offers the warfighter tools to shape the battlespace in ways never before possible. It provides opportunities to impact operations across the full spectrum of conflict and is pertinent to all possible futures. The purpose of this paper is to outline a strategy for the use of a future weather-modification system to achieve military objectives rather than to provide a detailed technical road map.</p><p>A high-risk, high-reward endeavor, weather-modification offers a dilemma not unlike the splitting of the atom. While some segments of society will always be reluctant to examine controversial issues such as weather-modification, the tremendous military capabilities that could result from this field are ignored at our own peril. From enhancing friendly operations or disrupting those of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of natural weather patterns to complete dominance of global communications and counterspace control, weather-modification offers the war fighter a wide-range of possible options to defeat or coerce an adversary. Some of the potential capabilities a weather-modification system could provide to a war-fighting commander in chief (CINC) are listed in table 1.</p><p>Technology advancements in five major areas are necessary for an integrated weather-modification capability:</p><ol><li>advanced nonlinear modeling techniques,</li><li>computational capability,</li><li>information gathering and transmission,</li><li>a global sensor array, and</li><li>weather intervention techniques.</li></ol><p>Some intervention tools exist today and others may be developed and refined in the future.</p>",

We have interviewed leading climate change scientists, conducted additional research, and reviewed several iterations of the scenario with these experts. The scientists support this project, but caution that the scenario depicted is extreme in two fundamental ways. First, they suggest the occurrences we outline would most likely happen in a few regions, rather than on globally. Second, they say the magnitude of the event may be considerably smaller. We have created a climate change scenario that although not the most likely, is plausible, and would challenge United States national security in ways that should be considered immediately.&rdquo;</blockquote>",

There is agreement that advances in the past few decades over a broad front of understanding physical processes and in technology have not been comprehensively applied to weather modification. Such advances need to be capitalized upon in the form of a concerted and sustained national effort to carry out basic and applied research in weather modification. The need for credible scientific evidence and the pressure for action should be resolved. Differences in the perception of current knowledge, the utility of numerical models, and the specific needs of research and operations in weather modification must be addressed. The increasing demand for water and the cost to society inflicted by severe weather require that the intellectual, technical, and administrative resources of the nation be combined to resolve whether and to what degree humans can influence the weather.<br><br>The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation<br><br>Michael Garstang, Roelof Bruintjes, Robert Serafin, Harold Orville, Bruce Boe, William Cotton, and Joseph Warburton, 2005: Weather Modification: Finding Common Ground.

            details: "A duct in Earth’s ionosphere is characterized by density gradients perpendicular to themagnetic field, which enhance refractive indices and act as waveguides to whistler-rangewaves. Interhemispheric ducts along magnetic field lines have implications for thetransmission of ELF radio waves across the globe. Strong HF ionospheric heating has been shown to create a depletion of electrons at the heated region and could lead to a pressure perturbation that propagates along the entire magnetic field line, potentiallyforming an artificial duct. Here we present results from an ionospheric numerical modelused to study the effects of localized HF heating on an interhemispheric magnetic fluxtube. The existing Sami2 is Another Model of the Ionosphere (SAMI2) ionospheric modelhas been modified to include a flexible source of strong HF heating that can be varied tomimic the fluctuations in HF heating efficiencies and ionospheric conditions. Our  parametric study includes varying the heating source intensity and location along themagnetic field line, revealing both linear and nonlinear relationships connecting thesesource parameters to maximum pressure, temperature, and density perturbations; propagation velocity of density perturbations; and characteristic heating and cooling timesof the irradiated region. After a transient state, the duct structure achieves a quasi-steadystate, showing electron depletion at the heated region and density enhancements in theregions just below and above the heated region. The density perturbations propagate deepinside the plasmasphere to the conjugate F2 peak, with density enhancements along thetraveling pulse boundary. The possibility of generating interhemispheric ducts is discussed.",

Eastlund<br>Eastlund Scientific Enterprises Corporation, Houston, TX</strong></p><p>HAARP MENTIONED: (06:30)</p><blockquote>&ldquo;put a rectenna on the space station and have a big base array antenna on the surface of the Earth beam it up and collect the energy and determine the transmission effects, losses, and that sort of thing, and then we would hope to put an antenna on the station, the do the opposite: beam it down to the surface of the Earth.&rdquo;</blockquote>(19:20)<br><blockquote>&ldquo;Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more plumes of atmospheric particles which will act as a lens or focusing device.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Throughout history, mankind has sought to minimize the impact of the unpredictability and severity of violent storms such as tornadoes. To date, solutions have focused early warning and on development of fortified buildings made to withstand the strong forces that are the hallmark of these atmospheric events. Sophisticated prediction methods have been developed to warn populations of potential storm danger. These &ldquo;warn and seek shelter&rdquo; mechanisms have clearly reduced the loss of life and, to a lesser extent, property damage associated with these natural events. However, despite our best efforts, loss of life and costly property damage are still strongly associated with severe weather phenomenon. This paper will describe a new concept that may improve computer simulation of these violent weather systems. Using ground-based beams of electromagnetic radiation, ionized plasma patches are created in the atmosphere. These active areas are expected to provide a research tool to understand storm phenomena.</p><p>Advanced computer simulations of severe weather systems, such as the ARPS code, require accurate boundary condition information. Data, such as wind profiles as a function of altitude, are an essential input. Hurricane simulations likewise have identified the steering winds as crucial to the development and track of hurricanes. This paper describes a method of creating atmospheric ionized plasma patches. These can be used as implements for rapidly heating well-defined regions of a weather system. Ground based microwave phased arrays, focused on specific locations in the atmosphere, will be used to create the plasma patch and to heat the atmosphere. A roadmap for application of such a capability to weather research and eventually to weather modification will be described. Initial experiments would correlate heating in a specific region of a weather system with computer simulations of the weather system.</p><p>Eventual applications include controlled modification of severe storm systems. One such objective is to prevent concentration of storm energy in tornadoes and to diffuse it over a larger area. The anticipated result is minimum impact on overall weather without the death and destruction from tornadoes.</p><p>If it does prove possible to prevent tornadoes, then systems are envisioned for intervention in other severe storm phenomena. Hurricanes and typhoons may be modified in some beneficial fashion, and weather modification could be a routine operation in the twenty-first century. This initial approach is focused on research to increase our simulation and understanding of storm dynamics.</p>",

            video: ["o3rAZ8Fmc0Q"],
            details: "<blockquote><p><strong>Use of commuter aircraft with their <span style='color: #ff0000;'>jet fuels doped with aerosol generators</span></strong> is another possibility. Also the use of UAVs or blimps for aerosol dispersal could be considered. Potential adverse consequences, however, are likely including impacts on precipitation, local cold temperature extremes (which would also impact fossil fuel demands) and the hydrological cycle. …</p><p>3.4 Seeding cirrus clouds or making more contrails</p><p>On an annual average clouds cover between 55 to 60% of the earth (Matveev 1984) and much of that cloud cover consists of middle and high clouds. It is thought that globally cirrus clouds contribute to warming of the atmosphere owing to their contribution to downward transfer of LW radiation. In other words they are a greenhouse agent. Human activity is already modifying the cirrus clouds through the production of aircraft contrails. Kuhn (1970) found that contrails depleted solar radiation and increased downward LW radiation but during the daytime their shortwave influence dominates and they contribute to a net surface cooling. Kuhn (1970) calculated that if contrails persist over 24h their net effect would be cooling. Others have concluded that they lead to surface warming (Liou et al. 1991; Schumann 1994) but Sassen (1997) notes that the sign of the climatic impact of contrails is dependent upon particle size. Global estimates of the effects of contrails are they contribute to a net warming (Minnis et al. 2004).</p><p>It has even been proposed to seed in clear air in the upper troposphere to produce artificial cirrus which would warm the surface enough to reduce cold-season heating demands (Detwiler and Cho 1982). So the prospects for seeding cirrus to contribute to global surface cooling do not seem to be very good.</p><p>The only approach that might be feasible is to perform wide-area seeding with soot or carbonaceous aerosols which would absorb solar radiation and warm cirrus layers enough to perhaps dissipate cirrus clouds (a&nbsp;semi-direct effect). This strategy would be similar to that proposed by Watts (1997) and Crutzen (2006) for implementation in the stratosphere. As noted by Crutzen (2006) only 1.7% of the mass of sulfur is needed to produce a similar magnitude of surface cooling. Application at cirrus levels in the upper troposphere would have the double benefit of absorbing solar radiation thus contributing to surface cooling and dissipating cirrus clouds which would increase outgoing longwave radiation. Of course, the soot that becomes attached to ice crystals will reduce the albedo of cirrus thus countering the longwave warming effect to some degree. In addition, there is evidence that soot particles can act as ice nuclei, thus contributing to greater concentrations of ice crystals by heterogeneous nucleation but possibly reduced crystal production by homogeneous nucleation (DeMott et al. 1994; Kärcher et al. 2007). Thus it would be best to engineer carbonaceous aerosol to be ineffective as IN.</p><p>The possible adverse consequences of such a procedure can only be conjectured at this time but are mostly likely to impact the hydrological cycle. Complex chemical, cloud-resolving, and global models are required to evaluate the feasibility of this approach and to estimate possible adverse consequences. The feasibility of this approach in terms of implementation strategies is probably comparable to seeding sulfates in the lower stratosphere. The costs would be similar to Crutzen’s estimates for stratospheric seeding.</p></blockquote>",

The four new research projects are:</p><ul><li><strong>Cloud, Aerosol and Precipitation in the Marine Boundary Layer.</strong> Scientists will take advantage of the user facility's ARM Mobile Facility - a heavily instrumented portable atmospheric laboratory - to study low marine clouds and aerosols in the Azores. Led by Dr. Robert Wood from the University of Washington, the new award extends an original 9-month project duration on Graciosa Island from March 2009 to November 2010. Doubling the length of the deployment will provide significantly greater statistical reliability of the relationships between aerosol and cloud properties required for evaluation of climate and process models.</li><li><strong>Arctic Lower-Troposphere Observed Structure.</strong> This 2-month campaign in 2010 will focus on the fall transition season, when sea ice begins to form and dramatic changes in aerosol and cloud properties occur. Led by Dr. Johannes Verlinde from the Pennsylvania State University, the science team will use a heavily instrumented tethered balloon to make routine ascents and descents in the lower 2 kilometers of the atmosphere at Oliktok Point, Alaska. Supplemented with measurements from an instrumented ground station, this campaign will be the first to capture a full atmospheric profile of in situ cloud microphysics, aerosols and radiative measurements during the Arctic transition season. The unique data set will provide a thorough case for testing Arctic cloud processes used in climate models, and for testing the algorithms used to retrieve these measurements.</li><li><strong>Small Particles in Cirrus Clouds.</strong> Mid-latitude cirrus clouds are the focus of this study that will use instrumented aircraft to sample clouds above the user facility's Southern Great Plains site in Oklahoma. Led by Dr. Jay Mace from the University of Utah, this field campaign will occur between October 2009 and June 2010, spanning the time of year when cirrus clouds are shown to be most prevalent above the site. Data from the campaign will help scientists to address many outstanding questions regarding mid-latitude cirrus properties and processes, and to validate and implement improved algorithms for measurements of cirrus clouds at all the user facility's research sites.<br>An intensive phase of the project will focus more on microphysical processes and field a more extensive set of experimental probes that observe the aerosol and ice nuclei properties of the upper troposphere. <strong>DOE and NASA will jointly conduct the intensive phase of the experiment.</strong></li><li><strong>Storm Peak Lab Cloud Property Validation Experiment.</strong> Dr. Mace is also the lead scientist for the study of liquid and mixed-phase clouds at the Storm Peak Laboratory near Steamboat Springs, Colorado. This campaign will debut the user facility's second mobile unit, which is currently under development. It will be deployed from approximately October 2010 through March 2011 at a location near the laboratory, which operates at an elevation of 3210 meters above sea level. The close proximity of the mobile facility and the laboratory's instrument platform is expected to result in a correlative data set equivalent to between 200 and 300 aircraft flights in liquid and mixed-phase clouds.</li></ul>",

The higher the cirrus, the greater their impact is on OLR. Thus by changing ice crystal size in the coldest cirrus, OLR and climate might be modified. Fortunately the coldest cirrus have the highest ice supersaturation due to the dominance of homogeneous freezing nucleation. Seeding such cirrus with very efficient heterogeneous ice nuclei should produce larger ice crystals due to vapor competition effects, thus increasing OLR and surface cooling. Preliminary estimates of this global net cloud forcing are more negative than −2.8Wm−2 and could neutralize the radiative forcing due to a CO2 doubling (3.7Wm−2). <strong>A potential delivery mechanism for the seeding material is already in place:<span style='color: #ff0000;'> the airline industry.</span></strong> Since seeding aerosol residence times in the troposphere are relatively short, the climate might return to its normal state within months after stopping the geoengineering experiment. The main known drawback to this approach is that it would not stop ocean acidification. It does not have many of the drawbacks that stratospheric injection of sulfur species has.</p></blockquote> David L Mitchell and William Finnegan, Desert Research Institute, Reno, NV",

These “contrail cirrus,” which artificially increase Earth’s cloudiness and become almost indistinguishable from natural cirrus, are among the most uncertain contributors to the Earth’s radiative forcing.

            details: "<p>Technologies that prevent sunlight from reaching Earth’s surface could reduce average global temperatures within a few years, similar to the effects of large volcanic eruptions.  While many albedo-modification techniques have been proposed, the committee said two strategies that could potentially have a significant impact are injection of aerosols into the stratosphere and marine cloud brightening.  Unlike carbon dioxide removal, these methods would not require major technological innovation to be implemented and are relatively inexpensive compared with the costs of transitioning to a carbon-free economy.</p><p>However, albedo modification would only temporarily mask the warming effect of greenhouse gases and would not address atmospheric concentrations of CO2 or related impacts such as ocean acidification.  In the absence of CO2 reductions, albedo-modification activities would need to be sustained indefinitely and at increasingly large scales to offset warming, with severe negative consequences if they were to be terminated.  In addition, albedo modification introduces secondary effects on the ozone layer, precipitation patterns, terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and human health, with unknown social, political, and economic outcomes.</p><p>Many of the processes most relevant to albedo modification -- such as those that control the formation of clouds and aerosols -- are among the most difficult components of the climate system to model and monitor.  Present-day observational capabilities lack sufficient capacity to monitor the environmental effects of an albedo-modification deployment.  Improvements in the capacity to monitor direct and indirect changes on weather, climate, or larger Earth systems and to detect unilateral or uncoordinated deployment could help further understanding of albedo modification and climate science generally.</p><p>The committee said it would be “irrational and irresponsible” to implement sustained albedo modification without also pursuing emissions mitigation, carbon dioxide removal, or both.  It opposed deployment of albedo-modification techniques, but recommended further research, particularly “multiple-benefit” research that simultaneously advances basic understanding of the climate system and quantifies the technologies’ potential costs, intended and unintended consequences, and risks.</p><p>Albedo-modification research will have legal, ethical, social, political, and economic ramifications.  The committee recommended the initiation of a serious deliberative process to examine what international research governance structures may be needed beyond those that already exist, and what types of research would require such governance.  The degree and nature of governance should vary by activity and the associated risks, and should involve civil society in decision-making through a transparent and open process.</p>",

That didn’t happen, Long reported during the American Geophysical Union fall meeting in San Francisco.</p><p>Instead, Long and his colleagues found that at the continental United States sites they analyzed, direct downwelling shortwave radiation remained roughly steady between 1995 and 2007, under cloud-free skies. Rather, it was the diffuse shortwave radiation that increased. That simply couldn’t happen if fewer aerosols alone were the reason behind the brightening. If anything, fewer aerosols should mean less diffuse shortwave radiation, because particles in the atmosphere can bounce light around and back to space.</p><p>So the scientists dug deeper, and in a provocative new analysis, not yet published, Long suggests that a high-altitude “ice haze,” created by water and other emissions from aircraft, is responsible. “I’m talking about a sub-visual contrail-generated haze of ice, which we do not classify as a cloud but gives blue sky more of a whitish tint.” Long said.</p><p>The finding—if verified—could mean that we are in essence already conducting a geoengineering experiment on the atmosphere, adding ice particles that change the way solar radiation reaches Earth’s surface. Understanding the overall impact of those changes on warming or cooling at the surface will take more research, Long said.</p>",
