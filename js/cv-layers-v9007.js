The mosaics are compiled by combining regional base reflectivity radar data obtained from 158 Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) also known as NEXt-generation RADar (NEXRAD) sites across the country operated by the NWS and the Dept. of Defense and also from data from Terminal Doppler Weather Radars (TDWR) at major airports. The colors on the map represent the strength of the energy reflected back toward the radar. The reflected intensities (echoes) are measured in dBZ (decibels of z). The color scale is very similar to the one used by the NWS RIDGE2 map viewer. The radar data itself is updated by the NWS every 10 minutes during non-precipitation mode, but every 4-6 minutes during precipitation mode. To ensure nowCOAST is displaying the most recent data possible, the latest mosaics are downloaded every 5 minutes.

The circle in the model is centered over the latitude and longitude coordinates of the station.

(Cloud cover is not presently displayed due to a problem with the source data. Present weather information is also not available for display at this time.) Wind speed and direction are represented by a wind barb whose line extends from the cover cloud circle towards the direction from which the wind is blowing. The short lines or flags coming off the end of the long line are called barbs. The barb indicates the wind speed in knots. Each normal barb represents 10 knots, while short barbs indicate 5 knots. A flag represents 50 knots. If there is no wind barb depicted, an outer circle around the cloud cover symbol indicates calm winds.

The irradiances at the Earth's surface are especially important in understanding the climate processes, since the Earth's surface transforms approximately 60% of the solar radiation absorbed by the planet. These irradiances also occupy an important position in the ocean surface energy budget, ultimately influencing the major features of ocean currents.</p><p>While a small change in irradiance at the Earth's surface may cause a profound change in climate, the existing radiometric network is not capable of arriving at the required accuracy for climate research. In fact our present understanding of the radiation distribution both - horizontally and vertically - is not sufficient to understand the present climate. The simulation of the past and future climate changes, which would be induced by the change in radiation, is even more uncertain.</p><p>This was the background for the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Radiative Fluxes Working Group to initiate a new Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) to support the research projects of the WCRP and other scientific programs.
