Sea surface temperatures influence weather, including hurricanes, as well as plant and animal life in the ocean. Like Earth’s land surface, sea surface temperatures are warmer near the equator and colder near the poles. Currents like giant rivers move warm and cold water around the world’s oceans. Some of these currents flow on the surface, and they are obvious in sea surface temperature images. Special microwave technology allows the AMSR-E sensor on NASA’s Aqua satellite to measure sea surface temperatures through clouds, something no satellite sensor before it was able to do across the whole globe.<br><br>The Aqua AMSR-E is a cooperative effort between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (JAXA) of Japan, with the collaboration of scientific and industry organizations in both countries. AMSR-E data are produced by Remote Sensing Systems and sponsored by the NASA Earth Science REASoN DISCOVER Project and the AMSR-E Science Team.<br><br>Source: AMSR-E, Remote Sensing Systems, and the NASA Earth Observatory.", sourceURL: "http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/planetary/earth/", name: "Sea Surface Temperature"},

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one way of measuring these effects. The NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation. It is based on the fact that healthy vegetation absorbs most of the visible light that hits it and reflects a large portion of the near-infrared light, while unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near-infrared light.<br><br>The NDVI can be calculated using data from a number of different satellites and sensors. The particular images you see here were produced from data measured by the SeaWiFS sensor aboard the SeaStar satellite (operated by one of NASA’s commercial partners, GeoEye) and processed by NASA’s Ocean Color team.<br><br>Source: The SeaWiFS Project, NASA, and GeoEye.

Yet as important as phytoplankton are to life on Earth, their interaction with our planet has only recently been studied on a global scale.<br><br>To convert sunlight to chemical energy, ocean plants use chlorophyll, the same chemical that gives terrestrial plants their green color.
